% Cincinnati Children's Translation Style Guide

General
=======

1.  For languages which use Latin script:

    a.  Keep the names *Cincinnati Children's, Cincinnati Children's Hospital,* and *Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center* in English.

    b.  On first mention, medication names and Cincinnati Children's departments and divisions are translated, followed by the English name in parentheses. Subsequent mentions use the translation only.

2.  For languages which do not use Latin script:

    a.  On first mention, medication names, *Cincinnati Children's, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center*, departments, and divisions are translated, followed by the English name in parentheses. Subsequent mentions use the translation only.

3.  Location letters (e.g. *D* in *Location D*), building names, and addresses in the United States remain in English.

    a.  Many Cincinnati Children's buildings are named with letters such as *Location D.* Specific floors in those buildings are referred to with the building letter and floor number, e.g. *D2.*

4.  For all HIM and HIC barcoded documents (Note: the barcode in the footer is not usually displayed in Word. Instead, something like *\*DTM1234\** is displayed.):

    a.  Make the titles bilingual.

    b.  Add *THE ENGLISH VERSION OF THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES AND MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE MEDICAL RECORD* above the header on the first page in English only, centered, 8 pt. Times New Roman, regular.

    c.  Add the ISO 639-1 Code of the target language after the form ID in the left side of the footer, e.g. J1194-AR for the Arabic translation of form J1194.

    d.  Ensure the HIC date below the form ID matches the source document, even when using a template with a different date.

5.  Ensure no essential elements are closer than one quarter inch to the edge of the page.

6.  Whenever a form has a signature line labeled *Witness,* make that label and any additional corresponding labels (e.g. *Date)* bilingual. Witnesses usually only speak English but are often asked to sign translated forms to indicate they were present when the form was signed by a limited English proficient person.

7.  Always translate text embedded in images. This may be done by overlaying text boxes or editing the image in Photoshop. When this cannot be done cleanly, contact the project manager for further instructions.

8.  Dates: In English source documents, dates will likely be written month/day/year. In translations, when not limited by space, spell out the month, e.g. *August 7, 2015* instead of *8/7/2015* or *7/8/2015*. When limited by space, use the ISO 8601 date format: year (four digits), month (two digits) and day (two digits), e.g. *2015-08-07*.

9.  Whenever something isn't clear, or sounds potentially inappropriate when translated, ask for clarification.

10. When translating *Knowing Notes*:

    a.  Keep the following elements of footer in English: number (e.g. *KN0123*), copyright notice (e.g. *┬⌐2016 Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center*) and revision date (e.g *01/16*).

    b.  When the logo indicates the *Knowing Note* is for Home Care, add the title in English to the header of the translation, right justified (left justified for right-to- left languages), 8 pt. Arial, regular.

11.  When translating *Health Topics*, add *Health Topic: Title* in English to the footer of the translation, right justified (left justified for right-to-left languages), 8 pt. Arial, regular, e.g. *Health Topic: Hearing Loss.*

        a.   *Health Topics* usually include *HT* in the file name. If you are unsure if a documents is a *Health Topic* or not, ask.

12. For translations into English, add *Translated by Cincinnati Children's* to the footer of the translation, right justified, 8 pt. Arial, regular.

13. For citations on References pages at the end of documents, keep everything as-is, but add a translation of the title in \[brackets\] after the English title.

2.  For times, rather than using only AM (∩║╗∩║æ∩║Ä∩║ú∩║Ä) and PM (┘ï╪í ∩╗ú∩║│∩║Ä), use ╪╕∩«¡╪▒╪º┘ï, ∩╗ƒ∩»╛∩╗╝┘ï and ∩╗ï∩║╗╪▒╪º when appropriate.

3.  Unless instructed otherwise, use Western Arabic (European) numerals instead of Arabic-Indic (Eastern Arabic/Indian) numerals in translations.

4.  When space does not permit translating credentials into Arabic, use the English abbreviations.

5.  In patient medication calendars, the name of the month should be bilingual with the English in parentheses.

6.  Do not use optical kerning in Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator or any other desktop publishing software.

7.  Replace Microsoft Office form field checkboxes with the Unicode ballot box character: ΓÿÉ (U+2610) or Γÿæ (U+2611).

8.  When translating the *Cancer Program Family Update*:

    a.  Keep the date range above the Events and Activities list on page 2 in English so staff can easily tell when the document is outdated.

    b.  For this list of doctors at the bottom of page 2, use the female version of the title for females.

1.  Our electronic medical record system does not support spaces, hyphens or diacritics in names. To account for this:

    a.  Add missing diacritics to common names.

    b.  When it's clear that a surname on a source document is actually a paternal surname and maternal surname joined without a space, separate and capitalize the surnames in the translation, e.g *Garc├¡a Rodr├¡guez* as the translation of *Garciarodriguez.*

2.  The following terms must be translated as follows:

Concourse
 ~ Pasillo principal

Location *(e.g. Location D)*
 ~ ├ürea
