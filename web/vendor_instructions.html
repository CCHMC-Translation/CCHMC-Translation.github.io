<h1 id="all-projects">All Projects</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Include the Cincinnati Children’s project number in all email messages. This number is usually ISTR#####.</p></li>
<li><p>We may submit requests for quote, or pre-approved requests for translation. This will be indicated in the request. We expect that the final cost of each quoted line item not exceed 130% of the quoted cost. Notify the Translations Coordinator if you expect costs to exceed this limit.</p></li>
<li><p>All documents are to be translated and reviewed by two different professional translators. If this is not possible for any reason, contact the Translations Coordinator and wait for approval before delivering documents which have not been reviewed.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit completed translations in Wordbee with a press-quality PDF version as the Deliverable and the native file format as an Attachment.</p></li>
<li><p>If translating outside of Wordbee, use the XLIFF export/import. Do not further segment the XLIFF in your CAT tool.</p></li>
<li><p>A linguist who specializes in the target language must review the final native files and PDF.</p></li>
<li><p>Send official quote or order confirmation to <a href="mailto:translations@cchmc.org">translations@cchmc.org</a> the same day that work on the project begins.</p></li>
<li><p>Append or change the language code in the file name of target files to the corresponding ISO 639‑1 Code. For example, the source files “name_EN.docx” and “title.docx” would become “name_AR.docx” and “title_AR.docx” when translated to Arabic, and “name_ES.docx” and “title_ES.docx” when translated to Spanish.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>When source files are named as clean or track-changes, usually abbreviated “cln” and “trk,” use the clean filename as the base.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>For InDesign and Illustrator files deliver a package containing:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>All native typefaces used in the piece (no outlines)</p></li>
<li><p>All linked art/photos</p></li>
<li><p>Print resolution PDF without crops/bleeds for our visual reference</p></li>
<li><p>An IDML conversion file (InDesign only)</p></li>
<li><p>If your design team has any notes, please have them fill out their contact information and anything of note in the “Instructions” file that normally gets generated when the file is packaged out of InDesign.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Follow the <a href="http://cchmc-translation.surge.sh">Style Guide</a> for all projects.</p></li>
<li><p>For any documents with known issues, do not mark the job as Completed. Once errors get out in the wild, it can be hard to ensure they're corrected. Let us know the document will be delivered late, the reason for the delay, and when you expect to have the corrected one for us. If we want the problematic document anyway because of time constraints, we'll let you know!</p></li>
<li><p>If there are comments or tracked changes in a source document, ask the Translations Coordinator what should be done with them before proceeding.</p></li>
<li><p>Foster open communication with translation teams. If a font is too small for the target language, there are errors in the source document, or something in the source document or project instructions is not clear, contact the Translations Coordinator.</p></li>
<li><p>If it appears that a document has already been translated (e.g. more than 85% of the document is a 95% TM match or better), ask the Translations Coordinator what should be done before proceeding.</p></li>
<li><p>Notify the Translations Coordinator immediately if a requested delivery date may not be feasible. We need as much time as possible to make alternate plans.</p></li>
<li><p>If you need something to be done (adapted from <a href="http://www.cyrusstoller.com/2014/01/08/stop-sending-emails-for-real-time-requests">Cyrus Stoller</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In 30 minutes: call 513-803-6929</p></li>
<li><p>Today (unless it’s already after 4:30 PM): Slack</p></li>
<li><p>Tomorrow or later: email <a href="mailto:translations@cchmc.org">translations@cchmc.org</a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>When you receive a question or request from any Cincinnati Children’s employee outside Language Access Services, redirect them to <a href="mailto:translations@cchmc.org">translations@cchmc.org</a>. Do not answer their question or fulfill their request.</p></li>
<li><p>When using a computer-assisted translation (CAT) tool, use the automated quality assurance tool to check for numerical issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Triple check the accuracy of medication dosages and timing in any translation.</p></li>
<li><p>Only consider a request a Rush if explicitly specified in the request. If you determine that the deadline of a non-rush request is too soon, and the request would need to be treated as a Rush, ask the Translations Coordinator if the deadline can be adjusted before proceeding.project therwise ask.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the same fonts as the source file. If a source font does not support the target characters, use Noto Sans (except for Arabic: use Frutiger Arabic).</p></li>
<li><p>Translate all non-editable text in source files. If there are more than 70 words of non-editable text in a source file, send it to the Translations Coordinator for addition to the Wordbee project as an additional source document so that it can be included in the TM.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="special-projects">Special Projects</h1>
<p>Any of the following specific needs will be indicated in the project request.</p>
<h2 id="protected-health-information-phi">Protected Health Information (PHI)</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Always transmit documents through secure channels.</p></li>
<li><p>PHI is information, including demographic information, which relates to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>the individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition,</p></li>
<li><p>the provision of health care to the individual, or</p></li>
<li><p>the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual, and that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe can be used to identify the individual. Protected health information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number) when they can be associated with the health information listed above.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Once the translation is completed and delivered to us, remove the PHI from any and all files you retain for record keeping. Ask all vendors contracted for the project to do the same. Specifically, the following identifiers of all our patients, or of relatives, employers, or household members of patients, must be removed<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Names</p></li>
<li><p>All geographic subdivisions smaller than a state, including street address, city, county, precinct, ZIP code, and their equivalent geocodes</p></li>
<li><p>All elements of dates (except year) for dates that are directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, death date, and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age 90 or older</p></li>
<li><p>Telephone numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Fax numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Email addresses</p></li>
<li><p>Social security numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Medical record numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Health plan beneficiary numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Account numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Certificate/license numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Device identifiers and serial numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs)</p></li>
<li><p>Internet Protocol (IP) addresses</p></li>
<li><p>Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints</p></li>
<li><p>Full-face photographs and any comparable images</p></li>
<li><p>Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code, except as permitted by 45 C.F.R. 164.514(c).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>See our business associate agreement for more details on handling PHI.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="certificate-of-accuracy-of-translation">Certificate of Accuracy of Translation</h2>
<p>If a Certificate of Accuracy of Translation is needed, provide a digital copy only.</p>
<h2 id="information-extraction">Information Extraction</h2>
<p>Rather than translate the entire document, extract and translate only the indicated information. For example, for immunization records, we only need a table of the following information: patient’s name, vaccine, lot number, and date given.</p>
<h2 id="html-source-files">HTML Source Files</h2>
<p>For CBDI calendars: No DTP required. To create the PDF, first unzip the folder in Attachments, placing it in the same location as the target HTM file. This will allow the web browser to properly format the target file. A PDF of the properly formatted source file will be in Attachments for reference.</p>
<p>For all other HTML files, ask if DTP required.</p>
